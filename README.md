# Code samples
## Software Engineer - Mission Planning position at ispace, inc.

This repository is a temporary collection of code I worked on the past two years within various projects. When necessary, due permission has been obtained to share it publicly. The repo is divided in 3 categories:
- C# (ESA Phi-Lab/Master thesis)
- Python (Riscognition)
- JavaScript (Sen2Cube.at)

These samples are part of larger programs with components of lesser interest for review. All of the C# and Python code was written by myself, while the JavaScript/Ember samples were initially written by someone else and heavily modified by myself. Details can be provided upon request.
